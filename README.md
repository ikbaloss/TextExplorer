This HTML app can be used to explore text through keyword-in-context (KWIC) analysis using both graphical and tabular views. To interact with the text, you can double-click a word displayed in the graph to center it as the keyword. To select a sequence of words, click any word other than the centered keyword. For example, if you click a word labeled “L2” (two words to the left of the centered keyword), the Focus column in the concordance table will display “L2–L1–Keyword.”

You can also add a stopword file and configure the graph to display only non-stopwords by toggling the stopword option.

The app can be accessed directly at: https://ikbaloss.github.io/TextExplorer/
